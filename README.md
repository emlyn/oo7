# oo7

A Clojure library designed to help with debugging.

## Usage

Add a `oo7` dependency to your project, and refer the `oo7.core/spy` macro in your code:
```clojure
(ns my.ns
  (:require [oo7.core :refer [spy]]
            ...
```

Insert calls to `spy` in your code.
Each call will log the position in the code (namespace, file, line, column),
as well as the time, and the names and values of all locals (`let` bindings).

If you pass one or more arguments to `spy` they will also be logged,
as well as the amount of time they take to be evaluated.
The return value will be the value of the last argument (as in a `do`),
so you can wrap existing code in a call to `spy` without changing the structure of your code.
